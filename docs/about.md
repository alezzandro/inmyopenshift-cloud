The aim of this project and its authors is to bring to OpenShift platform a bunch of templates for deploying in the more easier way existing applications.<br>
<br>
Just because many software vendor already provide a containerized version of their product, all the templates you'll find in the page would try to use any exisisting container and may give you all the necessary tips for configuring your OpenShift for better running the chosen containerized application.<br>
<br>
Every project/template has its own git repository on GitHub with associated a github page and a custom subdomain in <b>inmyopenshift.cloud</b>.<br>
<br>
